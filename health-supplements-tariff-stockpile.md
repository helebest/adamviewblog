# Top Imported Health Supplements to Stockpile Before U.S. Tariffs Hit

As of April 2025, the U.S. government has rolled out new tariff hikes targeting goods from major trading partners like China, Canada, and Mexico. These changes, including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, are poised to impact a wide range of products—including health supplements. For American consumers who rely on imported vitamins, minerals, and herbal remedies, this means higher prices could be just around the corner. Now’s the time to stockpile key imported supplements to avoid the inevitable cost surge and keep your wellness routine intact.

In this blog, we’ll break down which imported health supplements you should prioritize, why they’re at risk, and how to store them effectively. Let’s dive in and help you stay ahead of the tariff wave.

## Why Tariffs Matter for Your Supplements

The dietary supplement industry heavily depends on imported ingredients, especially from China, which supplies over 70% of raw materials like vitamins and amino acids. Canada and Mexico also play big roles, exporting finished products and botanicals like agave-based prebiotics. With tariffs set to increase costs across the supply chain, experts predict price hikes of 10-15% (or more) for many health products in the coming months. Stocking up now can save you money and ensure you’re not left scrambling when shelves run low or prices skyrocket.

## Top Imported Supplements to Stockpile

Here’s a curated list of must-have imported health supplements to grab before tariffs fully kick in. These picks are based on their popularity, sourcing origins, and potential price vulnerability.

### 1. Vitamin C (China)
- **Why Stockpile?** China dominates the global supply of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), producing over 90% of what’s used in U.S. supplements. The new 20% tariff will likely drive up costs for this immune-boosting staple.
- **How Much?** Aim for a 6-month supply (e.g., 180-200 tablets at 500-1000 mg each).
- **Storage Tip:** Keep in a cool, dry place away from sunlight to maintain potency.

### 2. Omega-3 Fish Oil (Canada)
- **Why Stockpile?** Canada is a major exporter of high-quality fish oil, often processed from wild-caught fish. The 25% tariff could make these heart-healthy capsules pricier.
- **How Much?** Stock up on 3-6 months’ worth (e.g., 90-180 softgels).
- **Storage Tip:** Store in the fridge to prevent rancidity and extend shelf life.

### 3. Ginseng (China)
- **Why Stockpile?** Authentic ginseng, especially varieties like Panax ginseng, is almost exclusively sourced from China. Tariffs will hit this energy-boosting herb hard, with no easy domestic alternative.
- **How Much?** Get 3-6 months’ supply (e.g., 100-200 capsules or a few ounces of dried root).
- **Storage Tip:** Store in an airtight container in a dark, dry spot.

### 4. CoQ10 (China)
- **Why Stockpile?** Coenzyme Q10, vital for heart health and energy, is another Chinese-dominated ingredient. The tariff increase could push prices up significantly.
- **How Much?** Aim for 3-6 months (e.g., 90-180 softgels at 100-200 mg).
- **Storage Tip:** Keep at room temperature, sealed tightly to avoid oxidation.

### 5. Agave Inulin (Mexico)
- **Why Stockpile?** This prebiotic fiber, derived from Mexican agave, supports gut health but faces a 25% tariff hike. Stock up to maintain your digestive wellness affordably.
- **How Much?** Grab 6-12 months’ worth (e.g., 1-2 lbs of powder).
- **Storage Tip:** Store in a cool, dry pantry in its original packaging.

## How to Stockpile Smartly

- **Check Expiration Dates:** Most supplements last 1-2 years unopened. Buy what you can use before they expire.
- **Buy in Bulk:** Look for deals on multi-packs from trusted retailers to maximize savings.
- **Store Properly:** Heat, humidity, and light degrade supplements. Use airtight containers and cool, dark storage spaces.
- **Monitor Usage:** Don’t overbuy—calculate your daily needs to avoid waste.

## Why Act Now?
