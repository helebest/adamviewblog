# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications. It's designed to make building React applications easier and more efficient.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features that make it a popular choice for React developers:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static site generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for even better performance.
- **File-based routing**: Creates routes based on the file structure in the pages directory.
- **API routes**: Allows you to create API endpoints as part of your Next.js application.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**: Makes styling your application easier.

## Creating Your First Next.js App

To create a new Next.js application, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

This will create a new Next.js application in a directory called my-next-app. Once the installation is complete, you can navigate to the directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js application will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Creating Pages

In Next.js, pages are React components exported from files in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

For example, to create a page at the route /about, you would create a file at pages/about.js:

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is the about page of our Next.js application.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a powerful and flexible framework for building React applications. With its built-in features for server-side rendering, static site generation, and more, it's a great choice for developers looking to build high-performance web applications.
