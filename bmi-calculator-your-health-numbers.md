# BMI Calculator: Understanding Your Health Numbers

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation that helps assess whether you're at a healthy weight for your height. Our BMI calculator makes it easy to determine your BMI and understand what the results mean for your overall health.

## What is BMI?

BMI is a numerical value calculated from your weight and height. It provides a quick screening tool to identify potential weight problems in adults. The formula is:

BMI = weight(kg) / height²(m²)

## How to Use Our BMI Calculator

1. Go to [adamview](http://adamview.pro) and find the BMI Calculator tool
2. Enter your height (in centimeters or inches)
3. Enter your weight (in kilograms or pounds)
4. The calculator will instantly display your BMI value
5. Review the category your BMI falls into (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese)

## Understanding Your BMI Results

- **Below 18.5**: Underweight - may indicate nutritional deficiency
- **18.5 to 24.9**: Normal weight - generally considered healthy
- **25.0 to 29.9**: Overweight - may increase risk of health problems
- **30.0 and above**: Obese - significantly increases risk of various health conditions

## Why BMI Matters

Knowing your BMI can help you make informed decisions about your health. While BMI is not a perfect measure (it doesn't account for muscle mass or body composition), it provides a useful starting point for health discussions with your doctor.

Regular BMI monitoring can help you track changes in your body weight relative to your height and take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
